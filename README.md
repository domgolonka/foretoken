## About

ThreatDefender is a tool to scrape for potential dangerous threats faced on the internet. The list of threats scraped at
the moment is:

    - Generic
    - Free
    - Spam
- IPs
    - VPN
    - Spam

This tool saves those threats on multiple different databases and uses REST API to outdata

# Usage

## Migrate

**BEFORE YOU RUN THIS**, You need to migrate the database:

`make migrate`

## Work in progress

Lots of features are being worked on.

## Roadmap

I would like a discussion going on the potential expansion of the tool.

I would like this tool to detect all modern threats.
