## About

ThreatDefender is a tool to scrape for potential dangerous threats faced on the internet. The list of threats scraped at
the moment is:

- Emails
    - Disposable
    - Generic
    - Free
    - Spam
- IPs
    - VPN
    - Spam
    - Proxy
    - Tor

This tool saves those threats on multiple different databases and uses REST API to outdata

# Usage

## Migrate

**BEFORE YOU RUN THIS**, You need to migrate the database:

`make migrate`

## How to run

To run it on your local computer:

`make run`

The default config file is `config/config.dev.yml`. If you want to run it with a different config file (or add your own).

`make build` (make sure to build it first)

`./bin/threatdefender --config=/PATH/TO/CONFIG`

example:
`./bin/threatdefender --config=config/config.prod.yml`

# Configs

All configurations are in the config files in the directory "config". You can add your own environment variables here.

## Change the databases

At this moment, Threat Defender only supports SQLite and PostgreSQL. You can change the `databasename` field with either `postgresql` or `sqlite3`

For Postgresql, I would advise using a quick read/write database like [timescale](https://www.timescale.com/). 

# APIs

REST API & gRPC is enabled.

### gRPC 

The default gRPC port is 8082 (you can change in the config)


### REST API

The REST API to the example app is described below.

## Work in progress

Lots of features are being worked on.

## Roadmap

I would like a discussion going on the potential expansion of the tool.

I would like this tool to detect all modern threats.
