# ThreatScraper

Note: This is still in alpha release and the API might break over time.


## About
ThreatScaper is a tool to scrape for potential dangerous threats faced on the internet. 
The list of threats scraped at the moment is:
- Emails
  - Disposable
- IPs
  - VPN 
  - Spam
  - Proxy
    

This tool saves those threats on multiple different databases.


## Work in progress

I am currently working on many different features.

## Roadmap
I would like a discussion going on the potential expansion of the tool.
